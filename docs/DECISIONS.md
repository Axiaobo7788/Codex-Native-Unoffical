# Architecture Decision Log

This file records durable project decisions and the reasoning behind them. Do not silently reverse an accepted decision. If a decision changes, append a new entry that supersedes the old one.

## ADR-001 — Use Flutter for the client UI

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Use Flutter/Dart for desktop and Android presentation layers.

### Why

- Android is a first-class target, not an afterthought.
- The product is dominated by conversation, task, diff, approval, and streaming UI rather than deep native C++ integration.
- A shared component/domain layer is valuable across desktop, phone, and tablet.
- Long lists can be virtualized and kept within a bounded UI working set.

### Consequence

Linux/Wayland performance must be tested early, especially on NVIDIA systems.

## ADR-002 — Reuse stock Codex app-server

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

The client must use the stock `codex app-server` as the Codex harness/runtime rather than reimplementing the agent.

### Why

The project aims to replace presentation and remote-control layers, not Codex intelligence. Reusing app-server preserves Codex prompts, tools, compaction behavior, approvals, skills, MCP, plugins, and upstream improvements.

### Consequence

The app-server protocol is the primary integration boundary.

## ADR-003 — Keep the local Codex runtime out of process in v1

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Desktop v1 starts `codex app-server --listen stdio://` as an independent child process and communicates via newline-delimited JSON.

### Why

- Process isolation makes crashes and memory growth independently recoverable.
- Users can upgrade Codex independently of the client.
- It stays on the supported app-server boundary.
- JSON/pipe overhead is negligible compared with model/tool latency.

### Consequence

`flutter_rust_bridge` is not required in v1. An embedded transport may be revisited later only if profiling shows meaningful benefit.

## ADR-004 — Android is a remote control plane

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Android should connect to a host running Codex rather than run the full Codex runtime locally by default.

### Why

This avoids Android filesystem, sandbox, PTY, toolchain, and background-process limitations while keeping the development environment on the real host.

### Consequence

OpenAI/Codex credentials remain on the host. The remote protocol must support pairing, authentication, reconnect/resume, and large-payload streaming.

---

## ADR-005 — Bounded UI memory is a product requirement

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

The Flutter UI must never treat full Codex thread history as resident application state.

### Rules

- Paginate turns/items.
- Virtualize long lists.
- Keep only an active working set in memory.
- Show summaries for large tool output and load full content on demand.
- Load diff content per file/hunk as needed.
- Inactive threads should approach zero presentation-layer memory cost.

### Why

A core project goal is to avoid the double pressure of a large Codex runtime plus a heavyweight UI retaining the same long-running session history.

---

## ADR-006 — Preserve Codex fidelity by default

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Default behavior must not secretly rewrite system prompts, replace tool schemas, or perform client-side context compaction.

### Why

The project should behave like Codex with a different presentation layer, not like a separate agent harness that merely uses the same model.

---

## ADR-007 — License under Apache-2.0

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Use Apache License 2.0 for the project.

### Why

It matches the upstream Codex project's permissive style, is friendly to community ports and packaging, and includes explicit patent terms without adding copyleft restrictions.

---

## ADR-008 — Put a bounded native Host between Flutter and app-server

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-11-05

### Decision

Desktop production transport runs a lightweight Rust `codex-native-host`. The
Host supervises the stock `codex app-server`, incrementally validates its JSONL
stdout, removes large command-output strings before Flutter receives a message,
and exposes bounded output reads through opaque references.

The Host is a transport and lifecycle boundary. It does not replace Codex
prompts, tools, compaction, protocol semantics, or the agent loop. Remote clients
will later connect to this same boundary rather than introduce a second harness.

### Why

- Dart's normal JSON decoder must materialize a complete JSON string before a
  typed adapter can discard `aggregatedOutput`.
- Current app-server item reads can still return an entire command output in one
  response; upstream output deferral makes list responses safer but does not
  provide byte ranges.
- An incremental native boundary can keep both the Host and Flutter projection
  bounded, spool selected output with explicit caps, isolate process failure, and
  become the natural owner of authenticated Remote transport.

### Consequence

- Desktop release bundles must build and ship `codex-native-host` beside the
  Flutter executable.
- Flutter receives sanitized JSON plus output descriptors and must request only
  bounded ranges/tails.
- Spool files are session-scoped, owner-only, capped, and addressed only by
  opaque IDs. Paths never cross the protocol boundary.
- The Host cannot eliminate app-server's own serialization allocation because
  the reviewed upstream stdio writer creates a complete serialized `String`
  before writing. App-server, Host, and Flutter memory must be measured and
  reported separately.
