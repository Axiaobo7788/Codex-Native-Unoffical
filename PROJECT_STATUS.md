# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-11-05_

This file is the repository's durable project memory. Update it whenever a task materially changes implementation status, milestones, known blockers, or the next recommended step.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Flutter + Codex app-server vertical slice: IMPLEMENTED, VERIFIED, COMMITTED (`5089320`)**

**Phase 2 — Local usable Codex client: IN PROGRESS — thread metadata vertical slice locally verified**

## Current repository state

- Flutter application shells exist for Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android under the Dart package `codex_native_unofficial`.
- Desktop runtime flow is real, not mocked:
  - locate `codex` through `CODEX_EXECUTABLE` or `PATH`;
  - spawn stock `codex app-server --listen stdio://`;
  - decode fragmented/multiple JSONL messages;
  - correlate JSON-RPC requests and responses;
  - perform `initialize` followed by `initialized`;
  - surface typed runtime status to Flutter widgets;
  - capture a bounded stderr tail, report malformed protocol data and process exits, and close the child without leaving an orphan.
- `CodexTransport` isolates feature/domain code from the process implementation so a later `RemoteTransport` can preserve the same boundary.
- Typed thread operations now cover bounded `thread/list`, `thread/start`, metadata-only `thread/read`, history-excluding `thread/resume`, and exact-ID delete for smoke-test cleanup.
- The desktop UI lists at most 100 thread metadata rows, paginates with opaque server cursors, accepts a working directory for new threads, and exposes select/resume actions. It does not retain turns or raw protocol JSON.
- Conversation turns, streaming, approvals, diffs, and Android remote control are not implemented yet.
- Lightweight GitHub Actions CI is configured for format, analyze, tests, and a Linux debug build. Hosted CI has not run for the local Phase 1 commit yet.

## Completed

### 2026-11-05 — Phase 2 thread metadata vertical slice

- Added typed thread/domain models and isolated v2 serialization/parsing for list/start/read/resume.
- Enforced `includeTurns:false` for reads and `excludeTurns:true` for resumes so metadata UI cannot hydrate full history.
- Added a bounded thread controller with 25-row pages, a hard 100-row retention cap, opaque cursor pagination, deduplication, refresh, start, select, and resume state.
- Added a functional thread list/start/resume desktop surface using the existing theme tokens.
- Added exact-ID `thread/delete` only for deterministic cleanup of smoke-owned persistent threads.
- Added SIGTERM/SIGINT coordination on Linux/macOS so the Flutter process waits for bounded child shutdown rather than abandoning a loaded app-server.
- Added protocol/controller tests and `tool/thread_smoke.dart` for real list/read/resume/start/delete-cleanup validation.

### 2026-11-05 — Phase 1 local vertical slice

- Bootstrapped Flutter targets for Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android.
- Added typed initialization models, JSONL decoding, JSON-RPC correlation, notifications/server-request streams, and explicit protocol errors.
- Added process executable discovery, stock app-server startup, bounded stderr capture, abnormal-exit reporting, graceful EOF/TERM/KILL shutdown, and concurrent-close coalescing.
- Added the minimal runtime status UI for locating, starting, connected, not found, error, process-exited, unsupported, and stopped states.
- Added `tool/runtime_smoke.dart` for a real stock app-server handshake without launching the GUI.
- Added 11 focused tests covering fragmented/multiple/malformed JSONL input, request correlation, unknown response IDs, JSON-RPC errors, initialization, process exit, stderr context, graceful/concurrent shutdown, and typed UI state.
- Added local run/verification instructions and lightweight CI.

### 2026-11-05 — Repository foundation

- Created repository and selected Apache-2.0.
- Chose Flutter/Dart for the client UI and stock `codex app-server` as the runtime/harness boundary.
- Chose isolated stdio/JSONL for desktop v1 and a future authenticated resumable remote control plane for Android.
- Decided `flutter_rust_bridge` is not a v1 dependency.

## Validation evidence

All results below are from 2026-11-05 on Manjaro Linux x86_64 with Flutter 3.47.1 and Codex `0.166.0-alpha.5.1`.

- `dart format lib test tool`: PASS.
- `dart analyze --fatal-infos`: PASS, no issues.
- `flutter analyze --no-pub <ASCII symlink to repository>`: PASS, no issues.
- `flutter test --reporter expanded`: PASS, 18 tests.
- `flutter build linux --debug`: PASS.
- `dart run tool/runtime_smoke.dart`: PASS against the installed stock Codex; the initialize response identified Codex Desktop/app-server `0.166.0-alpha.5.1`.
- `dart run tool/thread_smoke.dart`: PASS against the installed stock Codex; listed 10 oldest threads, read and resumed an existing inactive thread without turns, started a smoke-owned persistent thread, and deleted that exact test thread.
- Real Linux GUI launch after the thread slice: PASS; the Flutter process spawned an app-server child and the child was no longer alive when the signal-coordinated GUI process exited.
- Secret/credential scan: PASS; no token, private-key, bearer, or assigned credential patterns found in the repository scope.
- Hosted GitHub Actions CI: NOT RUN for the local changes.
- Windows/macOS/Android builds and physical-device validation: NOT RUN in this Linux environment.

## Known risks / watch items

- Direct `flutter analyze` from this repository's Unicode filesystem path currently crashes Flutter 3.47.1's LSP byte-stream parser with a truncated initialization JSON message. The same source passes `dart analyze --fatal-infos` at the real path and `flutter analyze` through an ASCII symlink. This is preserved as a toolchain/path issue, not recorded as a clean direct-path run.
- The real GUI launch logged host GTK/Wayland warnings for ATK socket embedding and a missing cursor-theme asset. They did not prevent the window, handshake, or child cleanup, but should be rechecked during later Linux UI work.
- Live thread validation established three upstream lifecycle constraints: an ephemeral empty thread has no readable rollout; a new persistent empty thread is also unreadable until its first turn materializes a rollout; and resuming a thread owned by another app-server fails with `already has an active writer`. The UI/controller must not treat those cases as generic transient retries.
- After loading thread state, the tested stock app-server did not exit within the 3-second stdin-EOF window or the following 3-second SIGTERM window. The SIGKILL fallback completed at about 6.1 seconds and no child survived GUI exit. Shutdown is bounded and correct, but the latency/source should be investigated before release polish.
- The app-server protocol evolves; version differences must stay inside typed protocol adapters.
- Long-running sessions must not cause Flutter to hydrate unbounded history. Phase 2 must introduce metadata/page boundaries before conversation state grows.

## Next action

Continue Phase 2 with a turn vertical slice on a client-created thread:

1. add typed `turn/start` and `turn/interrupt` requests;
2. parse only the required item/agent-message/turn lifecycle notifications into domain events;
3. coalesce streaming deltas before notifying Flutter widgets;
4. retain a bounded recent conversation working set and keep command/tool output summarized;
5. run one controlled real turn, then inspect completion, failure, interruption, and approval behavior before broadening the UI.

Do not begin rich diffs, Android remote transport, or ecosystem management until the turn/approval workflow is real and tested.

## Milestone outline

### Phase 1 — Local vertical slice

- Flutter project: complete.
- Process transport and app-server handshake: complete and locally verified.
- Typed initialization/runtime UI: complete and locally verified.
- Tests and local Linux build: complete and locally verified.
- Hosted CI: configured, not yet run.

### Phase 2 — Local Codex workflow

- thread list/start/read/resume metadata;
- turn start, streaming events, completion/failure/cancellation;
- bounded conversation projection;
- approvals and basic diff/task state;
- one real small coding task completed through this client.

### Phase 3 — Bounded-memory UX

- paged turns/items, virtualized timeline, coalesced streaming, lazy tool output/diff/file content, bounded caches, inactive-thread eviction, and stress evidence.

### Phase 4 — Android remote

- host bridge, pairing/device identity, authenticated WebSocket, event sequence + ACK/resume, notifications/approvals, and chunked transfer.

### Phase 5 — Ecosystem

- Skills, MCP, Plugins, optional isolated plugin WebView, tablet UX, and multi-host support.
